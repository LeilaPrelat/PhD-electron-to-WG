Electron coupling to a waveguide mode (Cruz + Leila)

project overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/7456489821nzcssmvbqncb#9faea3

We use the image method to obtain the electrostatic potential. 

code d.h : 
- Models a grounded plane + biased rectangular wire with rounded corners.
- Uses the boundary element method to compute induced surface charge.
- Computes electrostatic potential at any point in space (x,y)
  	The code normalizes everything such that:
		- The potential on the wire is always 1.
		- The grounded plane remains at potential 0.
		- All computed potentials in space are dimensionless, ranging between 0 and 1.
		

All lengths are given in units of the x side-length a

g++ -o d.out d.cpp: --> ./d.out bb_value ss_value dd_value  N > output.dat

where:

bb = 2, aspect ratio (side length along y divided by side length along x).

ss = 0.1, rounding radius.

dd = 1, wire-plane distance in units of a.

N = 200, discretization points.

returns y/a, V(y/a)/V0 = output.dat

dxy.cpp : modify d.cpp to return x/a, y/a, V(y/a)/V0 = output.dat

dy.cpp : same as d.cpp but written in a different way. returns y/a, V(y/a)/V0 = output.dat
