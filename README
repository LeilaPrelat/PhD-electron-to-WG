.- /figures: schemes and figures

.- /permittivities: data of real materials, permittivities from Refractive Index (Si and Ge)

.- global_constants.py: define universal constants to import in all codes 

.- permittivity_epsilon.py: define \epsilon(\omega) of different materials

.- EELS.py: define functions for the EELS from Eq. 3 #paper 228, Eq. 25 paper 149.
this is defined per unit lenght. Later we define an effective lenght propagation Leff
and we integrate over the electron's trajectory.

.- plot_EELS.py: EELS per unit lenght: see the guide modes for different Ee 
   plot the dEELS/dy (EELS per unit lenght, not integrated over e- trajectory)
	- plot the EELS(k_parallel,w) to find the waveguide modes of
		- real materials. import function \epsilon_2(\omega)
		- fake materials adding Im(epsi_2) = 0.1 to make the EELS wider and see it better
	- plot the EELS(ze,w) integrated over k_parallel. 
		- ze is an important parameter and it determinates which modes are being excited

.- plot_EELS_integrated_over_kx.py : EELS's spectrum using Leff.
   plot EELS integrated over the y-coordinate by using Leff(k_par)=L0*f(k_par) and integrating over kx from 0 to infty
		 - EELS/L0 vs omega
		 
.- plot_EELS_integrated_over_kx_and_omega.py : total EELS.
   plot EELS integrated over the y-coordinate using Leff(k_par), over k_parallel, and over omega
   this double integral takes too much time. the integral limits of k_par depend on \omega because I integrate over k_x/k
   with k = omega/c. In addition, epsilon2(omega) depends on energy so is a double integral. 
 
   -- will approximate the integrals to a sum to see premilinar results

2025/04/15 comments: 
	-add small imaginary part to the epsilon_2(omega) + 0.01 for all frequencies
	-plot of dispersion relation was wrong. label x was kx instead of kpar 
	In addition, the formula from paper #149 ("EELS_no_QE") is defined for positive kx,
	then if I plot as a function of kx I need to be careful with this
	
GM may 15 feedback
thickness = 0.2 microns
-resolve before 1eV to see the waveguide modes 
-know until which electron distance (ze) we can excite modes
-see in each case where i am in the dispersion relation
-reduce the energy electron loss up to 1 eV or 10 eV at most
-if we are close enough in ze, we can still excite after the guide modes (in that plot we dont need a zoom)
